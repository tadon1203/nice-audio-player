# Implementation-ready standard

A ticket is complete by itself. The implementer reads the ticket and the code, not the spec. The implementer can start without a design decision:

- **How** (most important): the approach in a few lines. For example, where the state lives and which mechanism does the work.
- **What**: the public types and signatures, and the commands and messages that cross a process boundary, as code. No function bodies. **Public** means used from outside the file that defines it.
- **Where**: the files to create, change, and delete, test files included. This is a guide, not a contract. A glob or "all callers of `X`" is correct.

A decision is **open** when the What or the How is not known. Open decisions go to the user, never to the implementer. The implementer decides all other things.
